#+TITLE: Computing L-functions and Gross-Stark units using Hilbert Eisenstein series
* Introduction
Computation of algebraic invariants attached to real quadratic fields, using algorithms from [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00208-020-02086-2][DPV1]] and [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02490][DPV2]].
* Usage:

Navigate to the main directory, run
#+begin_src jupyter-python :session py :kernel sagemath :exports both :results scalar
load "main.sage"
#+end_src

* Examples

** Compute diagonal restriction derivative
*Currently not working*
** Detect Gross-Stark units
*Currently not working*
** Compute traces of diagonal restrictions
Using some slightly dubious sage code, we are able to compute traces to test a conjecture in DPV2, namely that if we form the Hilbert Eisenstein series attached to a ring class character on $F$, then the $p$-stabilisation is usually non-zero, but the trace down to level $p$ vanishes when $p$ is inert in $F$.

*** The trace does /not/ vanish when $p$ is split:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :session py :kernel sagemath :exports both :results scalar
trace_test(69,17, bd=3)
#+end_src
***  The trace vanishes when $p$ is inert:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :session py :kernel sagemath :exports both :results scalar
trace_test(57,17, bd=3)
#+end_src
In fact, the code suggests something stronger: that the diagonal restriction lies in the complement of the span of the degeneracy maps from level $p$.
